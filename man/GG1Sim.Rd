\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution}{arrival distribution (object from package
\emph{distr}).}

\item{serviceDistribution}{service‑time distribution (object from
\emph{distr}).}

\item{staClients}{integer, number of customers discarded as burn‑in
(stabilisation stage).}

\item{nClients}{integer, number of customers collected for statistics.}

\item{historic}{logical, record evolution of the statistics.}
}
\description{
R6 class that simulates a single‑server queue with a
general (i.i.d.) arrival distribution and a general service
distribution – commonly referred to as a \emph{G/G/1} system.  The
algorithm is exactly the same as the legacy S3 implementation
but the results are stored inside the object under field \code{out}.
}
\section{Stored metrics (slot \code{out})}{

\itemize{
\item \code{pn}   – empirical steady‑state probability vector \verb{P\{N = n\}}.
\item \code{l}    – mean number of customers in the system \emph{L}.
\item \code{lq}   – mean number of customers in the queue \emph{Lq}.
\item \code{w}    – mean waiting time in the system \emph{W}.
\item \code{wq}   – mean waiting time in the queue \emph{Wq}.
\item \code{eff}  – empirical efficiency \code{W / (W - Wq)}.
\item \code{rho}  – empirical traffic intensity \code{L - Lq}.
\item \code{historic} (optional) – matrix with the evolution of the variables
during the run when \code{historic = TRUE}.
