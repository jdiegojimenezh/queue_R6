\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution, serviceDistribution}{objects from package
\strong{distr} defining the inter-arrival and service-time laws.}

\item{servers}{Integer >= 1 (number of parallel identical servers).}

\item{K}{Integer >= 1, maximum queue size (capacity minus
servers).}

\item{staClients}{Warm-up customers to discard.}

\item{nClients}{Customers accepted for statistics.}

\item{historic}{Logical, keep full trajectory?}

\description{
Discrete-event simulation of a \emph{multi-server} queue with
finite capacity \strong{K} (maximum queue length).  The system can hold
at most \code{s + K} customers (up to \emph{s} in service, at most \emph{K} in the
waiting line).  Arrivals that find the system full are \strong{lost}.
