\title{GG1KSim â€“ simulated G/G/1/K queue (R6)}
\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution, serviceDistribution}{objects from package
\strong{distr} defining inter-arrival and service-time laws.}

\item{K}{integer, maximum queue size (>= 1).  The system
thus holds at most \code{K + 1} customers (1 in service, \emph{K} waiting).}

\item{staClients}{warm-up customers to discard.}

\item{nClients}{accepted customers on which statistics are based.}

\item{historic}{logical, store full trajectory?}
}
\description{
Discrete-event simulation of a single-server queue with
finite capacity \code{K} (system size = \code{K + 1}, including the job in
service).  Arrivals finding the system full are \strong{lost}.  This is
a direct R6 refactor of the legacy function \code{G_G_1_K()}.
