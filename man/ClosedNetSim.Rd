\arguments{
\item{serviceDistribution}{List of \code{distr} objects (one per node).}

\item{s}{Integer vector with the number of servers at each node.}

\item{p}{Routing matrix (\code{length(s)} × \code{length(s)}), row-stochastic.}

\item{nClients}{Total number of circulating customers \code{N}.}

\item{staClients}{Warm-up completions discarded from statistics.}

\item{transitions}{Number of completed services counted for statistics.}

\item{historic}{Logical, store the full trajectory?}
}
\description{
Pure simulation (event-driven) of a \emph{closed} queueing
network with a fixed population of \code{nClients} customers.  Each node
is a \code{G/G/s} queue.  After completing service a customer is routed
to the next node according to the user-supplied routing matrix \code{p}
(rows must sum to 1).  The algorithm is a line-by-line port of the
original S3 function, wrapped now in an R6 class.
