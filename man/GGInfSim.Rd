\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution, serviceDistribution}{Distributions from
package \strong{distr} describing inter-arrival and service times.}

\item{nClients}{Customers included in statistics.}

\description{
Discrete-event simulation of a queueing system with
unlimited parallel servers: every arrival starts service
immediately, therefore there is \strong{no queue} and the waiting-time
in queue is always 0.  The class keeps exactly the same interface
used by the other simulation models in this package.
