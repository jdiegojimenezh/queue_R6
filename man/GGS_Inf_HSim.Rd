\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution, serviceDistribution}{Objects from \strong{distr}
giving the inter-arrival and service-time laws.}

\item{servers}{Integer >= 1, number of servers (\emph{s}).}

\item{staClients}{Warm-up customers discarded from statistics.}

\item{nClients}{Customers collected for statistics.}

\item{historic}{Logical, store the whole trajectory?}

\description{
Discrete-event simulation of a multi-server queue
(\code{s} identical servers) fed by a \emph{finite} population of \code{H}
sources.  Each source alternates between \strong{inside} the system
(being served or waiting) and \strong{outside} where it generates its
own inter-arrival time.  The total population is constant and no
arrivals are lost.
