\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution, serviceDistribution}{Objects from \strong{distr}
defining the inter-arrival and service-time laws.}

\item{servers}{Integer >= 1, number of servers (\emph{s}).}

\item{H}{Integer >= 1, finite customer population.}

\item{Y}{Integer >= 1, replacement threshold.}

\item{staClients}{Warm-up customers discarded from statistics.}

\item{nClients}{Customers collected for statistics.}

\item{historic}{Logical, store the whole trajectory?}

\description{
Multi-server queue (\code{s} identical servers) fed by a
\emph{finite} population of \code{H} sources \strong{plus} a replacement rule:
when the number of customers \emph{inside} the system is \verb{<= Y}
the source that just left is immediately replaced by a new one
(fresh inter-arrival time is generated). For \code{Y >= H} the
behaviour degenerates to the plain \code{G/G/s/Inf/H} case.
