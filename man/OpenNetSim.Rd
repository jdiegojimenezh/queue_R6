\arguments{
\item{arrivalDistribution}{List of \code{distr} objects (or \code{no_distr()})
giving the external arrival law for every node.}

\item{serviceDistribution}{List of \code{distr} objects with service-time
laws.}

\item{s}{Integer vector, servers per node.}

\item{p}{Routing matrix; rows must sum to \eqn{\le} 1.  The
extra probability \(1 - \eqn{\sum_j p_{ij}}\) is interpreted as leaving
the network from node \emph{i}.}

\item{staClients}{Warm-up completions discarded from statistics.}

\item{transitions}{Number of completed services counted for
statistics.}

\item{historic}{Logical, collect whole trajectory?}

\description{
Discrete-event simulation of an \emph{open} queueing network
with external arrivals at one or more nodes and probabilistic
routing between nodes.  Each node behaves as a \code{G/G/s} queue.  The
internal logic is delegated to the legacy helper
\code{OpenNetwork_secuential()} so the numerical results remain
identical to the original S3 code, but all outputs are exposed
through the field \code{out} of the R6 object.
